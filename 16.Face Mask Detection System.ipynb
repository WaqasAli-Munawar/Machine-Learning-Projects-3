    "In the age of Covid-19, face masks and social distancing have become the new norm. Indoor places, such as restaurants and grocery stores, are legally required to have rules in place for the mandatory use of face masks. Having a worker, manually examining each person to make sure their mask is on, simply defeats the goal of limiting contact with people as much as possible. So, a real-time face mask detection system can be used to address this issue that will not only maximize efficiency but will also ensure to potentially save lives."

The [Cascade classifier](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml), designed by **OpenCV**, is used to detect the frontal face in live video via `detectMultiScale`. We can use a `while loop` to continue capturing images from the webcam.\n",

Based on the performance and accuracy of our model, the result of the binary classifier will be indicated by showing a `green rectangle` superimposed around the section of the face indicating that the person at the camera is **wearing a mask**, or a `red rectangle` indicating that the person on camera is **not wearing a mask**.\n",
